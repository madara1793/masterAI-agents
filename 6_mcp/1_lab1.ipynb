Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "move_file: Move or rename files and directories. Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation. If the destination exists, the operation will fail. Works across different directories and can be used for simple renaming within the same directory. Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n",
      "search_files: Recursively search for files and directories matching a pattern. Searches through all subdirectories from the starting path. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. Returns full paths to all matching items. Great for finding files when you don't know their exact location. Only searches within allowed directories.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Ingredients\n",
      "### For the Pastry:\n",
      "- 100g butter (chilled, plus extra for greasing)\n",
      "- 200g plain flour\n",
      "- 1 medium egg (separated)\n",
      "- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar\n",
      "\n",
      "### For the Filling:\n",
      "- 4 sliced bananas\n",
      "- 394g caramel (or dulce de leche)\n",
      "- 300ml double cream\n",
      "- Dark chocolate (for garnish, optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Method\n",
      "1. **Make the Pastry:**  Combine the butter and flour in a food processor until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and sugar, then mix again. Gradually add cold water until the dough comes together.\n",
      "2. **Chill the Dough:** Remove and knead gently into a ball. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.\n",
      "3. **Bake the Pastry:** Preheat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4. Grease a 23cm fluted tart tin, roll out the pastry, and line the tin. Snip off excess edges. Bake with baking parchment and beans for 15 minutes, then remove and brush with egg white. Bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden.\n",
      "4. **Assemble the Pie:** Spread half the caramel in the cooled pastry case, layer with bananas, and top with remaining caramel. Refrigerate.\n",
      "5. **Top with Cream:** Whip the cream until thick and spread over the pie. Garnish with grated dark chocolate, if desired.\n",
